# Week9-Codepath
I spent about **20** hours on this project.
# Honeypot Deployed
The honeypot that I deployed was Dionaea over HTTP.

# Issues I Encountered
The main thing I really struggled with was getting access to the mhm admin console. It took a long time to figure out what was actually wrong with the console. I soon discovered, after many hours of research, that I was missing the tcp 80 port. I feel like the instructions could have been a little more clear as to what needs to be done. It was a lot of guess and check. I spent a lot of time on this project and it was frustrating at times.
